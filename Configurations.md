## Configurations inherited from Kafka clients
The following configurations are inherited from the open source Kafka client configurations. They will be used by all the clients in Cruise Control to communicate with the Kafka cluster.

Besides the above configurations, CruiseControlMetricsReporter takes all the configurations for vanilla KafkaProducer with a prefix of "cruise.control.metrics.reporter."
